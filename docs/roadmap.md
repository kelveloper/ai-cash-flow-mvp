[Previous sections remain unchanged...]

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **AI Model Accuracy**
   - Risk: Initial forecasts may be inaccurate
   - Mitigation: Start with conservative predictions and clear confidence intervals
   - Fallback: Provide historical averages when confidence is low

2. **Data Integration**
   - Risk: Delays in real financial data integration
   - Mitigation: Maintain robust realistic simulated data system for development
   - Fallback: Start with non-sensitive realistic simulated data

3. **Performance**
   - Risk: Slow response times with complex AI calculations
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and async processing
   - Fallback: Progressive loading and skeleton screens

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**
   - Risk: Users may not trust AI-driven insights
   - Mitigation: Start with conservative, explainable insights
   - Fallback: Focus on traditional dashboard features

2. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Risk: Financial data handling regulations
   - Mitigation: Early legal review and compliance planning
   - Fallback: Start with non-sensitive realistic simulated data
